# Introduction to Deep Learning and Image Classification Using TensorFlow

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository for the project "Introduction to Deep Learning and Image Classification Using TensorFlow." This project is a part of my minor in Data Science, and I'm excited to share my progress and findings with you.

## Project Overview

In this project, I'm exploring various aspects of deep learning and image classification using TensorFlow. The primary goals are as follows:

1. **Binary Classification (Week 1-2)**
   - Determine if an image is a schema or a painting/photo.

2. **Image Treatment and Preprocessing (Week 3-4)**
   - Enhance and prepare the images for model training.

3. **Transfer Learning (Week 5-6)**
   - Leverage pre-trained models to improve classification accuracy.

4. **Image Captioning (Week 7-8)**
   - Generate AI-driven captions for selected images.

## Weekly Updates

I'll be sharing weekly updates on my progress, challenges, and exciting breakthroughs right here in this repository. You can follow along with the project's development and learn alongside me.
